 TECHNICAL PROJECTS
 Smart Cleaner IoT System with AWS Integration
 Designed a simulated cleaning robot using ESP32 and AWS IoT Core with X.509 certificate-based MQTT
 connection. Simulated device state includes battery, cleaning mode, sensors, position, schedule, and main
tenance logs. Published telemetry to cleaner/telemetry every 2 seconds and received remote commands
 (start, pause, dock) via cleaner/control. Implemented auto-docking, alert generation, and maintenance
 checks. Achieved seamless device-to-cloud communication and extensibility for multi-device scaling.
 IoT Temperature Sensor for Smart Home Automation
 Developed a complete home automation system simulating temperature, humidity, and battery using a
 virtual sensor in Python. Integrated with AWS IoT Core over secure MQTT using TLS and X.509 cer
tificates. Real-time data was processed using AWS IoT Rules and stored in DynamoDB. Generated smart
 alerts for temperature thresholds and logged events in CloudWatch. Demonstrated IoT fundamentals,
 device simulation, secure messaging, and real-time cloud processing.
 Adaptive Beamforming with Backscatter Tags
 Designed phased array antenna system using TI CC1352 LaunchPad with custom firmware for 0–120°
 phase control. Utilized SmartRF Studio for RF optimization and achieved significant signal-to-noise ratio
 improvement over omnidirectional antennas. Extensively used MATLAB Communications Toolbox and
 Phased Array System Toolbox for beamforming algorithm development, signal analysis, and radiation
 pattern optimization
 Wireless Sensor Network Implementation
 Developed IoT environmental monitoring system using Contiki-NG with RPL routing protocol. Imple
mented meshnetworking for robust sensor data collection and custom sensor integration modules.Implemented
 MATLAB-based network topology analysis and routing optimization algorithms
 Smart Plant Monitoring System
 Built Raspberry Pi Pico solution with I2C/UART sensors using Zephyr RTOS. Created real-time moni
toring dashboard with automated alerts and wireless data transmission capabilities.
