Unit Price for 10kU (US$) : 0.3626 TSSOP-20

The STM32C011x4/x6 mainstream microcontrollers are based on high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M0+ 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 48 MHz frequency. Offering a high level of integration, they are suitable for a wide range of applications in consumer, industrial and appliance domains and ready for the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.
The devices incorporate a memory protection unit (MPU), high-speed embedded memories (6 Kbytes of SRAM and up to 32 Kbytes of flash program memory with read and write protection), DMA, an extensive range of system functions, enhanced I/Os, and peripherals. The devices offer standard communication interfaces (one I2Cs, one SPI / one I2S, and two USARTs), one 12-bit ADC (2.5 MSps) with up to 15 channels, a low-power RTC, an advanced control PWM timer, four general-purpose 16-bit timers, two watchdog timers, and a SysTick timer.
The devices operate within ambient temperatures from -40 to 125°C and with supply voltages from 2.0 V to 3.6 V. Optimized dynamic consumption combined with power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.
The devices are housed in packages with 8 to 20 pins.
